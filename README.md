All I wanted was a tool that did the following:

- Serve static files
- Serve files even without an `.html` extension
- Automatically inject Livereload

I couldn't find a solution that did all of these things out of the box, so here you go.

## installing

```
npm install -g slrs
```

## usage

```
slrs [path/to/dir]
```

## license

public domain
